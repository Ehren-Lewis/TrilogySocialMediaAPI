## About This Project

 This application is a functioning backend based around MongoDB and Mongoose that allows for the creation of users, thoughts and reactions that a webstie would use as a backend

 As someone that wants to build a social media app one day, this is the perfect start to how the routing would work for how individuals would communicate

 I used MongoDB, Mongoose, Insomnia, Express for this project. Express was used as the server, Insomnia was used to trigger the routes in the application, Mongoose was used as the communication to MongoDB, and MongoDB is the database used for the project

 Some challenges faced was querying with Mongoose. Knowing the proper methods to use in what situation wasn't intuitive to me, but learning how to do so during this application was very beneficial

 For future iterations, my goal would be to allow user authentification and a frontend that would be paired with the backend that's already created

## How to Install


    1. Navigate to the code repository
    2. Press the green code button, located near the about section
    3. Copy either the HTTPS, Git CLI, download the zip, open with GitHub desktop, or copy the SSH link.
    4. Depending on download method, use Git, executable, or the desktop application to open the content files.
    5. All of the content of the repository will be available after completion of the previous state.
    

## Usage

 To use this project, download the necessary files with npm i, then run npm start. Once the port is open, open up insomnia. From here, you can create users, thoughts, and reactions by following the correct url pathing in the codebas

## Known Issues

Currently, there isn't much error handling on both the improper routes and improper mongoose querying. If anything goes 
wrong there, it may break the application and a relaunch would be necessary.
